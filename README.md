# Java-Task-Farmer-and-his-farms
I guess we will evolve the same project by adding more and more functionalities in already existing system. So letâ€™s start creating

1. Represent in code the following system:

A Farmer
A Farmer can have 1 or more Farms
Farms can be of 2 types: for growing animals or for growing plants
On Farm for animals can be breed animals of different types: cows, goats, pigs etc
On Farm for plants can be planted different trees: apples, pears, peaches, cherry etc


2. In main method create a Farmer and provide interactions from console for 
a) buying a new farm of a certain type
b) adding new plants and animals into given farm
c) printing the whole info about the Farmer and his farms

This will show your understanding of basic OOP principles, some I/O stuff while interacting with console and your creativity and ability to represent a real-life system in code
